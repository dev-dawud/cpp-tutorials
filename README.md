#      C++ Tutorial by David

Welcome to my C++ roadmap!  
This repository is organized into thematic folders, each containing source files with well commented examples (comments: explain everything to you also for beginners and entermediate).  
The goal is to explain concepts in a beginner friendly way while also keeping the code clean and structured.

##  Folder Overview

- **basics/**
  - `hello_world.cpp` → the classic first program  
  - `Variables_Data_Types.cpp` → variables & primitive types  
  - `input_output.cpp` → handling user input/output  
  - `operators.cpp` → arithmetic and logical operators  
  - `conditionals_if_else.cpp` → control flow with if/else  
  - `conditionals_switch.cpp` → switch statement example  
  - `loops_for_while_do-while.cpp` → looping basics  
  - `loops_for_while_do-while_solution.cpp` → exercise solution  

- **functions/**
  - `function_definition_calling.cpp` → defining & calling functions
  - `parameters_return_values.cpp` → more details on function usage  
  - `function_overloading.cpp` → using overloaded functions  


- **arrays/**
  - `simple_arrays.cpp` → static arrays  
  - `vectors.cpp` → introduction to `std::vector`  

- **classes_oop/**
  - (coming soon: classes, constructors, inheritance, etc.)  

- **pointers/**
  - (coming soon: working with pointers & memory management)
